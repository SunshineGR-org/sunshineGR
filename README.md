## Monorepo for SunshineGR

[SunshineGR](https://sunshinegr.org) is a US-based, non-profit project that improves access to public data published by the Greek government. Our mission is to empower citizens, journalists, and politicians, and promote transparency by making government data easily accessible and understandable.

Our first initative helped several candidates for the 2023 regional and municipal elections (including the winning candidate in Athens) to analyze the decisions of their local administrations and better prepare for their campaign.
